## Introduction

XYZ Bank is a financial institution that offers a wide range of products to its customers. One of the popular financial products is term deposits, which provide customers with a fixed interest rate for a specified period. To attract and retain customers, the bank conducts marketing campaigns. The objective of these campaigns is to identify potential customers who are more likely to deposit money in the bank and target them with personalized offers.

### Problem Statement

XYZ Bank faces fierce competition in the market and aims to expand its customer base. Conducting effective and targeted marketing campaigns is crucial. Therefore, the bank needs to identify customers with a high likelihood of making term deposits to optimize their marketing efforts and improve the conversion rate, leading to increased revenue.

### Goal

The goal of this analysis is to build a classification model capable of accurately predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. This will empower the bank to identify the most promising customers for their marketing campaigns, resulting in improved conversion rates and increased revenue.
